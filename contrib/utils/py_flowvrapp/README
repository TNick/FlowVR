What is this?
=============

This is a replacement for the C++ flowvr::app framework used to
describe the flowvr graph. In contrast with flowvr::app, it has no
fancy automatic building of the graph: all primitives (filters,
synchronizers, modules) must be defined individually and placed
explicitly.

The rationale for this is that the complexity and verbosity of the
graph description via flowvr::app outweights the advantages of
automatic placement.

The graph is built sequentially, inconsitencies are reported as
early and clearly as possible.

How does it work?
=================

A Python script generates the .cmd.xml and .run.xml files. It does not
need to be compiled or installed. There is no infrastructure in place
to handle parameters (.prm) or placement (.csv). Since the definition
is not compiled, this information can be conveniently put in the code,
or passed as command line parameters.

Files
=====

- flowvrapp.py contains classes for the basic objects of flowvr app
(Primitve, Module, Filter, Port) and generation code for the .run.xml
and .cmd.xml files

- filters.py contains classes for standard flowvr filters

- portutils.py is a limited implementation of the Portutils's
flowvrapp side. It contains the PortModule Primitive.

- balzac.py contains the BalzacLostInSpaceViewer and an implementation
of the Balzac tutorial.
