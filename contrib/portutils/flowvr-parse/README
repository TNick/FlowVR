    FlowVR Parse



This package provides the tools necessary to handle
the different xml files a FlowVR application need.   

Prerequisites
=============

flowvr-base and flowvrd must be properly installed.

openjade should be  installed to validate xml 
files against the DTD provided with flowvr-parse.
With a Mandrake distribution with configured urpmi resources: 
  urpmi -a openjade

openjade is note mandatory but strongly recommended.

To be able to generate graphical representations of flowvr networks it
is also recommended to install xsltproc and graphviz. 

Compilation
===========

Simply use 'make' in the root directory. This should create the
flowvr-module and flowvr-network programs in the bin directory.


Installation
============

To easily access the executables from the  bin directry add it to your path:

export PATH=path/to/flowvr-parse/bin:$PATH

If you have openjade installed, set the environment variable SGML_CATALOG_FILES
properly so nsgml can  find the xml catalog provided with openjade . It should look 
something like:

SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/path/to/xml.soc

Also add the path to the   flowvr-parse catalog provided:

export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/path/to/flowvr-parse/dtd/flowvr-sgml.cat:$SGML_CATALOG_FILES

Test
====


flowvr-module
-------------
if you have openjade installed and configured:

cd  test
./flowvr-module-test.sh -dtd

otherwise 

cd  test
./flowvr-module-test.sh 

Look at the files  availabe in this directory. 
This very instructive to understand what is going on.

flowvr-network
--------------

Note
====

Note that there exists several free xml editors.

Emacs  (and Xemacs) has an xml-mode that provides completion on tag names, etc.
(xml-mode provided by the psgml package usually already enclosed with emacs packages).
With openjade installed xml files  can directly be validated from emacs.
