FlowVR-render tutorial

type

 ./make-app.sh
 
first to compile the examples in this directory.

type

 . ./bin/tutorial-config.sh
 
to source the environment variables needed.


To launch the example, type:
 flowvrd & ; sleep 1 ; flowvr -x -L -Ptutorial:example=1 -Q config/tutorial.prm Tutorial
 
(only the last part will launch the application. The flowvrd is however
needed to run while the application is launched).

The launch script is copied to the flowvr-install dir upon installation.
 
You can switch the tutorial example with the example parameter:

- tutorial:example=1: a cube (you can rotate it)
- tutorial:example=2: a model (obj) that is loaded
- tutorial:example=3: a textured quad

Any other number will launch example 1 (the cube).
