FlowVR Render
=============

Overview
--------

FlowVR Render is an extension to FlowVR for parallel rendering.

Existing parallel or remote  rendering solutions rely on communicating
pixels, OpenGL  commands, scene-graph changes  or application-specific
data. FlowVR Render propose an intermediate solution based on a set of
independent  graphics primitives  where hardware  shaders are  used to
specify their visual appearance. Compared to an OpenGL based approach,
it  reduces the  complexity of  the  model by  eliminating most  fixed
function   parameters,   while   taking   advantage  of   the   latest
functionalities of graphics cards.

FlowVR  Render is  a  project  of  the  Laboratoire  Informatique  et
Distribution, Grenoble.
