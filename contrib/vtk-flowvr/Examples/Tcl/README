VTK FlowVR Examples
===================

To run the examples provided with the vtkflowvr package, you need to follow the following steps:

- Ensure that you have correctly set the environment variables by sourcing :
  * <flowvr-installdir>/bin/flowvr-suite-config.sh
  * <flowvr-installdir>/bin/vtk-flowvr-config.sh

- Launch flowvr with the vtkflowvr library and the path to the Tcl script to be executed.

For example, if you want to run the quadric example, first go to the example directory then launch :
flowvr -x -L vtkFlowVR -Pvtkflowvr:VTK_SCRIPT=./modules/quadric.tcl
